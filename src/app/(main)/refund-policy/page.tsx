          <p>
            At Enchanting Heart Spells, we are committed to providing authentic and dedicated spiritual services. The nature of spell casting involves time, energy, and material costs that are invested once a ritual begins.
          </p>
          
          <h2>No Refunds After Ritual Has Begun</h2>
          <p>
            Due to the spiritual nature of the work and the resources committed, we cannot offer refunds once the ritual for your spell has commenced. The moment you book a service, we begin preparations, including meditation, material gathering, and energetic alignment specifically for your case.
          </p>

          <h2>Understanding Spell Work</h2>
          <p>
            Spell casting is not a guaranteed science but a spiritual art. While we have a high success rate and countless happy clients, universal energies can be complex, and timelines for results can vary. The fee you pay is for the work performed, the materials used, and the time and energy dedicated to you, not for a guaranteed outcome.
          </p>

          <h2>Our Commitment</h2>
          <p>
            We promise to perform your requested ritual with the utmost care, skill, and positive intention. We also provide post-spell follow-up support to guide you. Our goal is your happiness and success, and we will do everything within our spiritual power to help you achieve your desired outcome.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            By booking a service with us, you acknowledge and agree to this refund policy.
